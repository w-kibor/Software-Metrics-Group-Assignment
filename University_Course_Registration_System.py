Title: University Course Registration System – Metrics-Based Refactoring

Project Description:

The following Python code implements a University Course Registration System, but the design has several issues that violate good software engineering principles.

Your task is to:

Analyze the code using software metrics (e.g., CK metrics, Cyclomatic Complexity, LOC, cohesion, coupling).

Identify problematic areas based on metric results.

Refactor the code to improve its maintainability and design quality.

from datetime import datetime


Part A: Metric Analysis (8 Marks)

Calculate the following metrics using manual computation or a tool (e.g., radon, pylint, lizard):

Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) for each method

Lines of Code (LOC)

Coupling Between Objects (CBO)

Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT)

Lack of Cohesion of Methods (LCOM)

Identify problem areas using metric values (e.g., methods with high CC, classes with low cohesion, high coupling, or long methods).

Part B: Diagnosis (6 Marks)

Explain why these metrics indicate potential design or maintenance problems.

Discuss how high coupling and low cohesion affect reusability, testability etc.

Part C: Refactoring (6 Marks)

Refactor the code to:

Reduce Cyclomatic Complexity in long methods (e.g., calculate_performance, full_report, main).

Reduce coupling between Registrar, Student, and Course.

Improve cohesion and encapsulation.

Provide your refactored code snippets and explain the improvement using before-and-after metrics.

Sumission Requirements:
All instructions are provided in University_Course_Registration_System.py.

Ensure that you include the list of group members and the GitHub link as the first items in your PDF file during submission.
Only one PDF file should be submitted — the code in the GitHub link must also be included in the PDF file.

Organize your work in an easy-to-read format.
